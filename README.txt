CS685 Final project
Xiaofei Zhang and Ayesha Dina

This folder contains two subfolders:
    DemoProgram1: generate 3 numbers that satisfies a<=b<=c
    DemoProgram2: generate 2 numbers that satisfies y=x**2
    
Library requirements to run the demo:
    Keras
    Tensorflow

Using GAN to generate test case:
To run the GAN:
    python gan.py
To evaluate the random results generated through training phase:
    python test.py
